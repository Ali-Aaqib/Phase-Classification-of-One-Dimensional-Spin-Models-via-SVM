Reproducible code to learn quantum phase boundaries using SVMs with fidelity-based kernels.
Includes analytic XY and xx-chain fidelity,  ED ground states , and an optional true SWAP test in PennyLane (toggle on/off; exact or shot-based).
it also includes XXZ ED ground states , and an optional true SWAP test in PennyLane (toggle on/off; exact or shot-based).
Fast path: disable SWAP; accurate path: enable SWAP with swap_shots=None (exact) or a finite number.
